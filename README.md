# odin-rock-paper-scissors

Created as part of The Odin Project, this is a page that let's you play 5 rounds of rock, paper, scissors against a computer and declares a winner.

This project displays HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills. In particular, DOM methods were used to allow interactivity with the page.
